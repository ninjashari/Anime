# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Anime Management System is a comprehensive web application that integrates with MyAnimeList API and Jellyfin media server to provide users with a centralized platform for tracking their anime consumption. The system will allow users to manage their anime lists, track viewing statistics, and automatically update their progress through Jellyfin integration. The application will feature a React.js frontend with Material-UI components and a Python backend with PostgreSQL database.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to register and login to the system, so that I can access my personalized anime tracking features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the registration page THEN the system SHALL display fields for name, username, and password
2. WHEN a user submits valid registration data THEN the system SHALL create a new user account and redirect to login
3. WHEN a user enters valid credentials on login page THEN the system SHALL authenticate and redirect to dashboard
4. WHEN a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
5. IF a username already exists THEN the system SHALL prevent registration and show error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a registered user, I want to generate and store MyAnimeList API access tokens, so that I can sync my data with MyAnimeList.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the token generation page THEN the system SHALL provide MyAnimeList OAuth integration
2. WHEN a user completes OAuth flow THEN the system SHALL store access and refresh tokens in user database
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them using stored refresh token
4. IF token refresh fails THEN the system SHALL prompt user to re-authenticate

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view my anime statistics on a dashboard, so that I can see my viewing progress at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the homepage THEN the system SHALL display total anime count from their lists
2. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show total episode count watched
3. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL calculate and display time spent watching
4. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL estimate time to complete planned anime
5. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL show mean score across all rated anime
6. WHEN dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a score distribution bar graph

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage separate anime lists for different viewing statuses, so that I can organize my anime consumption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses list pages THEN the system SHALL provide separate pages for currently watching, completed, on hold, dropped, and plan to watch
2. WHEN a user interacts with list items THEN the system SHALL call MyAnimeList APIs to update data
3. WHEN a user changes anime status THEN the system SHALL update both local database and MyAnimeList
4. WHEN a user updates episode progress THEN the system SHALL sync changes to MyAnimeList
5. IF API calls fail THEN the system SHALL queue updates for retry and show user notification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search for anime and add them to my lists, so that I can discover and track new anime.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters search terms THEN the system SHALL query MyAnimeList API for matching anime
2. WHEN search results load THEN the system SHALL display anime with title, image, and basic information
3. WHEN a user selects an anime THEN the system SHALL provide options to add to different lists
4. WHEN a user adds anime to a list THEN the system SHALL update both local database and MyAnimeList
5. IF search fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user with Jellyfin server, I want automatic anime progress updates when I watch episodes, so that my tracking stays current without manual input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Jellyfin completes episode playback THEN the system SHALL receive webhook with AniDB ID
2. WHEN AniDB ID is received THEN the system SHALL map it to corresponding MyAnimeList ID
3. WHEN mapping is successful THEN the system SHALL update episode progress in local database
4. WHEN local database is updated THEN the system SHALL sync progress to MyAnimeList
5. IF mapping fails THEN the system SHALL log the unmapped entry for manual review

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and manage AniDB to MyAnimeList mappings, so that I can ensure accurate automatic updates from Jellyfin.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the mapping page THEN the system SHALL display current AniDB to MyAnimeList mappings
2. WHEN mappings are displayed THEN the system SHALL show source (Jellyfin), AniDB ID, MyAnimeList ID, and anime title
3. WHEN a user identifies incorrect mapping THEN the system SHALL allow manual correction
4. WHEN mapping is corrected THEN the system SHALL update the mapping database
5. IF unmapped entries exist THEN the system SHALL highlight them for user attention

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive interface, so that I can easily navigate and use the application on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL use Material-UI components for consistent design
2. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL follow reusable component design patterns
3. WHEN accessed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL provide responsive layout
4. WHEN user interacts with UI THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and loading states
5. IF errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable data persistence and synchronization, so that user data remains consistent and available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user data is modified THEN the system SHALL store changes in PostgreSQL database
2. WHEN MyAnimeList data is fetched THEN the system SHALL cache it locally for performance
3. WHEN local and remote data conflict THEN the system SHALL prioritize MyAnimeList as source of truth
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and recovery
5. IF data synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL queue operations for retry

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to follow standard coding practices, so that the codebase is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL follow Python PEP 8 standards for backend
2. WHEN React components are created THEN the system SHALL follow React best practices and hooks patterns
3. WHEN database schemas are designed THEN the system SHALL use proper normalization and indexing
